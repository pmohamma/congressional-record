Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to recognize a wonderful 
organization in my district that this year is celebrating its 20th 
Anniversary, the Community Resource Center located in Mamaroneck, New 
York.
  The mission of CRC is today more important than ever. Formerly the 
Hispanic Resource Center, it is a 501(c)(3) community-based 
organization founded in 1998 to promote the cultural, economic, 
educational and professional integration of immigrants to the already 
established larger community. It is also dedicated to advocating for 
those in need. CRC aims to provide the tools to prepare new immigrant 
families to become self-sufficient and active members of the community.
  Over its 20 years in existence, CRC has grown from a community 
initiative designed and acting as a clearinghouse of information and 
referral services, to an organization that provides comprehensive 
direct client services and programs. The Center provides a host of 
educational programs, case management and referral services and 
advocate for immigrants and low-income families in need. In the past 
year, the Center served nearly 4,000 adults, youth, and children in 
three primary areas: Case management and social services; Educational 
programs and workshops; and Worker Center-job placement for men and 
women seeking employment. The Center understands that the Westchester 
community is strengthened by cultural and economic diversity, and the 
work they do in support of that cannot be overstated.
  Mr. Speaker, the America I know welcomes all immigrants and isn't 
afraid to lend a helping hand to those in need. I am proud to represent 
an organization like Community Resource Center that provides that 
loving hand every single day. Congratulations to the entire CRC team on 
20 wonderful years serving the community, and here's to many more.
                        


Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor for me to recognize a dear 
friend, Jerry Friedman, who this year is celebrating his remarkable 
90th birthday in addition to his 63rd wedding anniversary to his 
wonderful wife, Lillian.
  Lillian and Jerry were married in the Bronx on December 10th, 1955. 
Together they have two children, Lynn and Stuart, who were both born 
while the couple lived in Brooklyn, and now 2 grandchildren, Sophie and 
Ben. In 1971, the Friedman family moved to Co-op City, which is where 
Pat and I met them as members of the Co-op City Democratic Club. We 
have been close ever since.
  Jerry was a very active member on the Riverbay Board for many years, 
and at one point served as Vice President for three terms. He was also 
instrumental in the rent strike, acting as an advocate for residents. 
When I first ran for State Assembly, Jerry and Lillian were two of my 
earliest supporters. I'll never forget the faith they placed in me.
  Outside of his activism, Jerry is a wonderful amateur photographer 
whose pictures have hung in the Riverdale Y and other local spots. He 
was also very active in the Boy Scouts and over the years rose to their 
highest office.
  In addition, Jerry served on the Board of Visitors at Bronx 
Psychiatric Center, which provides a continuum of inpatient, outpatient 
and related psychiatric services with inpatient hospitalization at the 
main campus.
  Mr. Speaker, I have long cherished my friendship with Jerry Friedman 
and I count myself incredibly fortunate to have known him for so many 
years. He is a terrific individual who has done so much to help 
strengthen our community here in the Bronx, and I am honored to be able 
to recognize him on this wonderful occasion. Congratulations to Jerry 
on an incredible 90 years.
                        


Mr. BRADY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I have the opportunity to 
inform colleagues that Mr. Matthew Pinkus, our Committee senior policy 
adviser and parliamentarian to House Administration Committee 
Democrats, retired recently, concluding a congressional staff career 
which began as an intern in 1971 and included 19 years on our 
committee, the longest of the more than twenty different congressional 
professional positions he had held during that period, including time 
as chief legislative assistant to Rep. Michael Barnes (D) of Maryland 
for the congressman's entire tenure in the House.
  Whether working in House leadership, on five different congressional 
committees and in Members' offices, Matt excelled in a huge variety of 
tasks. A summer college job as a congressional intern in the House for 
Rep. Benjamin Rosenthal of New York while attending Brandeis University 
prompted Matt to leave graduate school at U.C. Berkeley after receiving 
an M.A. in political science and work in Washington full time, first at 
Congressional Quarterly, then for a month in the Senate, and then the 
remaining decades in the House. He said of that path, ``I decided very 
early on that, as much as possible, I would do things the way I wanted 
and try to have fun. Usually, that worked.''
  Matt had an eclectic career path since his first full-time job here 
in 1976, when he left a political reporting job at Congressional 
Quarterly. He often chose to seek work in specific subject areas which 
interested him, rather than follow the common alternate staff career 
path of attaching himself to one or two members and remaining in place. 
He was first appointed to the Committee on House Administration 
Democratic staff in 1991 by Rep. Sam Gejdenson of Connecticut to work 
on campaign finance reform, and then moved on to the Brookings 
Institution as a guest scholar on their ``Renewing Congress'' project 
before returning to the House in 1995 to work on oversight of the 
executive branch at the Committee on Government Reform. Between Hill 
jobs in the 1990s, Matt had finished writing a book for Congressional 
Quarterly in 1998, How Congress Works, and was ready to once again 
return to the House. Then-House Administration Ranking Member Gejdenson 
asked him to work on election contests, and he remained here to work 
sequentially for Ranking Members Hoyer, Larson and Chairwoman 
Millender-McDonald.
  Matt was probably best known on the Hill as one of the top experts on 
rules and process, serving on the Rules Committee staff and twice on 
the Subcommittee on Rules of the House, including as subcommittee staff 
director. His most distinctive job was as parliamentarian of the House 
Democratic Caucus for six years, which recognized and utilized his vast 
knowledge of the Caucus rules. It was a position created especially for 
him and lasted through the service of Chairmen Robert Menendez, Jim 
Clyburn, Rahm Emanuel and John Larson--all while he also worked 
simultaneously on the House Administration Committee. He was known for 
always being carefully prepared, totally candid, and was not 
intimidated by Members.
  Matt was always our committee parliamentarian, managed floor 
operations, and worked on elections legislation, congressional 
continuity issues, and the Smithsonian Institution. He drafted and 
edited views on committee reports and other publications, and proofed 
specialized historical books published by the House. He would discuss 
parliamentary strategy in the morning and then make an oversight visit 
to the National Zoo to learn about artificial insemination of Giant 
Pandas in the afternoon, something made possible by CHA's very eclectic 
jurisdiction.
  Matt sat behind me for years on the Committee on House Administration 
dais when I was a junior member and helped provide advice on hearings 
and markups for Members but when I suddenly became chairman in 2007 
following the death of Chairwoman Millender-McDonald, he was there with 
an intricately drafted manager's parliamentary script for my very long 
first markup. This was a totally new role for me. When I went off 
script at some points and noticed Matt's look of concern, after 
avoiding disaster, I told him that
while I might sometimes deviate from his text, he should just keep 
right on doing what he does.
  Matt says he plans to travel, look for opportunities to write, and 
again take up playing chess, which he learned at the age of four from 
his father, AI, who was one of America's leading players in the mid-
20th century.
                          



Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate one of the great 
religious institutions in my district, the Lincoln Park Jewish Center 
located in Yonkers. This year, the Center is celebrating its remarkable 
80th Anniversary and I would like to take the opportunity to recognize 
that feat in Congress.
  Lincoln Park Jewish Center is an inclusive, modern Orthodox Jewish 
congregation that strives to create spiritual growth through prayer, 
acceptance, community and fellowship. To achieve this goal, the 
synagogue supports the following: HaMakom Tefilah, a place to increase 
spirituality with heartfelt prayer by encouraging personal growth 
through participation, self-reflection, and spontaneity; HaMakom Ahavat 
Chinam, unconditional love and acceptance, regardless of background or 
current level of observance; HaMakom Limud Torah, a place to search and 
study Torah leading to a more fulfilling Jewish life; and HaMakom 
Simcha, a place to enjoy and celebrate.
  The congregation at Lincoln Park Jewish Center is currently led by 
Rabbi Levi Welton, who was ordained by the prestigious Machon Ariel 
Institute of Jerusalem in 2005 and has since then served congregations 
in Australia, San Francisco, and, of course, Yonkers New York. His 
pastoral experiences include young professional development, inter-
faith work, community building and multimedia production. Additionally, 
Rabbi Welton is the Founder of the Torah Values Network, a staff writer 
for New York Jewish Life Magazine, and a Captain in the United States 
Air Force.
  The Lincoln Park Jewish Center has provided incredible support to its 
congregants and the community for 80 years now. Here's to 80 more. 
Congratulations to Rabbi Welton and the entire Lincoln Park Jewish 
Center family on this great occasion.
                        


Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a dedicated public 
servant in the Yonkers community, Dr. Andrea Coddett, who this year has 
been named ``Woman of the Year 2018'' by the Luther V. Garrison Sr. 
Masonic Foundation Inc.
  Dr. Coddett is the Deputy Superintendent for the Yonkers Public 
Schools. In her role, she oversees the Division of Teaching and 
Learning, ensuring that all curriculum is aligned to the New York State 
Learning Standards and that all instruction is aligned to 21st Century 
learning skills, so students are prepared for college and or careers. 
As the Chairperson of the Yonkers Basics Advisory Board, Dr. Coddett 
leads a team of approximately 40 volunteer members from various 
community sectors charged with saturating the community with five 
research-based interactive pillars proven effective in redressing 
cognitive and social-emotional inequities due to poverty.
  Dr. Coddett began her career in education as a Special Education 
teacher after which she became a building-level Math Specialist. In her 
administrative career, Dr. Coddett has worked as a District Math 
Specialist PreK-12, an Early Childhood Principal, a K-5 principal, a 
Director of Secondary Special Education and an Assistant Superintendent 
for Instruction K-12.
  Dr. Coddett is a graduate of Fordham University where she earned a 
doctorate in Executive Leadership. She holds Masters Degrees in 
Curriculum and Instruction with a Reading specialization and 
Educational Administration from Pace University and a Bachelor degree 
in Psychology from Mercy College. Dr. Coddett also holds administrative 
certifications in School District Administration and School Building 
Administration and Supervision, as well as teaching certifications in 
Special Education, birth through 21, and General Education, N-6. Dr. 
Coddett continues to influence school transformation and policy 
decisions by serving on Carnegie Foundation's national Improvement 
Leadership Education and Development (iLEAD) steering committee with 
university and school-based educators committed to integrating 
improvement science principles into leadership development and 
educational practice.
  Having lived in and been educated in four different countries on 
three different continents, Dr. Coddett considers herself a global 
citizen. It is her contention that as an educational leader, she is one 
of the gate-keepers of tomorrow and believes that each and every child 
deserves an excellent education. As a former classroom teacher myself, 
I happen to agree wholeheartedly. Dr. Coddett has achieved a great deal 
and is well deserving of this honor. Congratulations to her on 
receiving this wonderful recognition.
                        


Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the largest co-
operative housing development in the nation and a place that holds a 
particularly meaningful place in my heart, Co-op City in the Bronx. 
This year, Co-op City celebrates its 50th Anniversary and as such 
stands as one of the great housing successes in our country's history.
  Co-op City is a New York State Mitchell-Lama housing cooperative with 
apartments in high-rise and townhouse buildings. There are three 
shopping centers on Co-op City property, 8 parking garages, 
professional offices and a complete educational park.
  Construction of Co-op City began in 1966 on a site that was formerly 
home to an amusement park at which I used to work as a young man called 
``Freedomland.'' Residents began moving into the complex in 1968, and 
construction was completed in 1973. Co-op City is divided into five 
sections, with each section denoted by a letter of the alphabet. Co-op 
City is managed by the Riverbay Corporation and is led by a Board of 15 
residents, each elected to three-year terms.
  Co-op City is a special place, not just to me, but to the thousands 
of people who have had the privilege of calling it home over the years. 
I myself am a former Co-op City resident, and my family and I lived 
there for many years. I have so many fond memories from my time there; 
from starting a family to beginning my career in public service, I can 
trace so many wonderful moments and life-events back to my Co-op City 
days. I can also trace so many wonderful friendships back to Co-op 
City, many I still cherish to this day.
  As fortunate as I was to have lived in Co-op City, I am just as 
fortunate to now represent Co-op City in the halls of Congress. I hope 
that my service can in some way give back to the community that has 
given me so much.
  As a part of the Mitchell-Lama housing program, Co-op City has 
provided quality housing at an affordable rate to generations of New 
Yorkers. As we celebrate its 50th Anniversary, it's important to 
reflect on just how fortunate we are to have such a strong and thriving 
housing development in the Bronx. I'm proud to say I lived in Co-op 
City, and I'm just as proud to still serve Co-op City today as 
Congressman.
  Congratulations to the Riverbay Board, the entire Co-op City 
community, and all the residents who have made the past 50 years in Co-
op City a tremendous success
                          



Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is my distinct privilege to honor and 
recognize the accomplishments of a dear friend, a dedicated public 
servant, and an overall wonderful human being, my colleague Congressman 
Joe Crowley. This year, the Ancient Order of Hibernians in the Bronx is 
honoring Joe at their Annual Dinner Dance. They could not have picked a 
more deserving honoree.
  Joe and I go way back, starting with our days together in Albany as 
Members of the New York State Assembly. A native of Woodside, Queens 
and lifelong New Yorker, Joe has served the people of the Bronx and 
Queens in Congress since 1998. Before being elected to Congress, Joe 
received a bachelor's degree from Queens College, ran a successful 
small business for nearly a decade and represented the 30th Assembly 
District in the New York State legislature. Throughout his career in 
public service, Joe has been driven by a desire to protect New York's 
middle class.
  Joe has always been dedicated to making the Bronx-Queens community 
more prosperous and secure. He established the Crime Stoppers program 
in 2002 to support local organizations that are working to reduce crime 
and improve the quality of life in our neighborhoods, and it has 
delivered more than $1 million in federal funding to the Bronx-Queens 
community for graffiti clean-up, after-school programming, and civic 
patrol efforts.
  As Chairman of the Democratic Caucus, the fourth-highest ranking 
position in House Democratic Leadership, Joe's efforts in Congress 
focused on building strong communities, creating jobs, increasing 
access to health care and housing, protecting seniors' hard-earned 
benefits, and opening up educational opportunities for working 
families.
  When not fighting for his constituents, Joe can be found spending 
time with his lovely family--wife Kasey Crowley and their three 
children--or playing with his band.
  Both local and national media have recognized Joe for his effective 
and impressive record of leadership in Congress. The New York Times has 
noted that his peers consider him to be a ``hard working 
representative'' who is ``an impassioned advocate for his district.'' I 
couldn't have said it better myself. Come January I will miss Joe's 
presence in Washington, but I know he will continue to be a powerful 
force for good in the New York City community. Congratulations to Joe 
on this honor and a remarkable career.
                        


Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, our houses of worship are often the ties that 
bind our communities together. In Rye, few institutions have been as 
successful in strengthening the neighborhood and bringing people 
together as the Community Synagogue of Rye, which this year is 
celebrating its remarkable 70th Anniversary.
  One Sunday in early autumn 1948, 7-year-old Betty Wolder asked her 
parents if she could go to church with her friend Susan who was 
Christian. Her parents explained that since they were Jewish and did 
not belong to Susan's church, she could not attend. Betty continued to 
ask questions and her parents wanted to give her better answers. The 
Wolders contacted the few Jewish people they knew in Rye about forming 
a Jewish religious school, and a sponsoring group of families. The 
response was extraordinarily positive, and the rest is history.
  A beautiful mansion--built in 1903 at 200 Forest Avenue--was 
purchased in June of 1950, and Rabbi Samuel H. Gordon, an experienced, 
widely traveled liberal Rabbi, was hired as the first spiritual leader 
in 1950. From there, Community Synagogue grew and flourished. The 
congregation is now around 500 families and over 300 students from Rye, 
and several communities between Greenwich and White Plains. The 
synagogue has an ambitious education program for both children and 
adults, numerous opportunities to become involved in social action, 
beautiful worship services, and life cycle celebrations. Their 
enthusiastic and active committees help make the synagogue a dynamic 
and caring community, and their work has grown beyond the congregation 
to serve the greater community.
  Community Synagogue of Rye has had an amazing 70 years. 
Congratulations to the leadership and congregation on this occasion.
                        


Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, the importance of a free and open press 
cannot be overstated, especially in our local communities. I am very 
fortunate to represent a district that is covered by the Irish Echo, an 
outstanding local newspaper, which is led by my friend and one of this 
year's Ancient Order of Hibernians' honorees, Ray O'Hanlon.
  As Ranking Member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I have had 
the pleasure of working with Ray for many years on a wide variety of 
topics, including Irish-American issues which have always been 
particularly close to my heart.
  Ray is the editor of the New York-published Irish Echo. A native of 
Dublin who worked for
the Irish Press newspaper group before moving to the United States in 
1987, Ray has reported from three continents in a news career spanning 
39 years.
  In addition to his work as a reporter and editor, Ray has been a 
frequent contributor to U.S., Irish, and British media outlets 
reporting on Ireland, Irish-American affairs, and Anglo-Irish 
relations. He has appeared on CBS 60 minutes, ABC World News Tonight, 
and the Lehrer News Hour on PBS. He has also been interviewed on RTE, 
BBC and ITV, both television and radio.
  A prolific writer, Ray's book, ``The New Irish Americans'' (Roberts 
Rinehart, 1998) was the recipient of a Washington Irving Book Award. 
``The South Lawn Plot,'' his first fiction work, was published in 2011 
by Boston-based Gemma Media publishers. Ray is currently working on a 
new book on Irish immigration that will have a particular focus on the 
1965 Immigration Reform and Nationality Act. A graduate of University 
College Dublin, Ray lives with his wife Lisa, a native of Danville, 
Illinois, in Ossining, New York. They have three grown children: Kate, 
Liz and Jack.
  Ray O'Hanlon has accomplished a great deal over a long and 
distinguished career. He is most deserving of this wonderful 
recognition from AOH. Congratulations to Ray and I thank him for all he 
continues to do on behalf of our community.
                          



Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an elected representative, but 
also as a mother--a mother who is horrified and outraged by the actions 
taken by the Trump Administration to deliberately separate families.
  Like any mother, I love my children and cannot imagine being 
separated from them. But because of the Trump Administration's 
policies, some mothers have no choice.
  Just this week, I have been working to reunite two mothers in my 
community who were prevented from reuniting with their families.
  The first story I want to share is of Maria Mendoza-Sanchez. Maria 
has lived with her family in the East Bay for more than two decades. 
She and her husband Eusebio raised four beautiful children, worked 
hard, and purchased a home in Oakland.
  Maria went to school while raising small children and went on to 
become a nurse at Highland Hospital. She was beloved by her patients 
and her colleagues.
  Maria and Eusebio tried to do the right thing. They paid their taxes 
and came forward to legalize their immigration status. And for years, 
they were on a path to citizenship.
  But like many families, Maria and Eusebio's efforts did not matter to 
the Trump Administration.
  Under President Trump's misguided enforcement priorities, Maria and 
Eusebio were targeted for deportation.
  And last summer--after more than twenty years building a life in our 
community--Maria and Eusebio were torn from their children and deported 
to Mexico.
  But over the last sixteen months, we didn't give up. We kept working 
to reunite Maria with her family--to bring her home.
  Finally, after more than a year of work, we were able to secure an 
H1-B visa for Maria. And this past Sunday, I was honored and overjoyed 
to join Maria as she was reunited with her children.
  But Maria isn't the only mother torn from her children by President 
Trump's immigration policies.
  Also in the news this week was the story of Shaima, whose son 
Abdullah Hassan has been on life support at Children's Hospital 
Oakland, in my district.
  Abdullah is two years old and suffers from a genetic brain condition. 
His mother Shaima, who was born in Yemen, has been barred from 
travelling to the United States to be with her son because of the Trump 
Administration's un-American Muslim ban.
  Abdullah doesn't have much time left--and Shaima feared that she 
would not be able to say goodbye to her young son.
  Mr. Speaker--is this really who we are? A country that denies mothers 
safe passage to be with their dying children?
  No family should ever have to endure this.
  And in the face of such unimaginable cruelty, I am proud to say that 
our community stepped up. I want to thank everyone who showed up, who 
protested and organized and petitioned for this outcome.
  Because of your advocacy, the State Department granted a visa waiver 
to Shaima so she can be with her son. She will be able to be with her 
son, to hug him and to say goodbye.
  But we know that there are many other people like Maria and Shaima 
who remain separated from their families.
  When I went down to the border earlier this year, I saw the prison-
like conditions that they were keeping children in.
  There were kids sleeping on concrete floor--with only thin emergency 
blankets to keep them warm.
  And to this very day, there are hundreds of children in HHS custody. 
And Secretary Nielson can't tell us when they will be reunited.
  Let's be clear: this isn't an immigration policy. This is a family 
separation policy.
  Children torn from their mothers, parents deported away from their 
kids. And it's up to Congress to stop it.
  It's past time for us to restore--justice, dignity and common sense 
to this immigration system.
  We need to ensure kids who have lived here their entire lives--like 
Maria's oldest daughter--can make a life in the only country they have 
ever known.
  We need to get this disgraceful, discriminatory travel ban off the 
books, so no loved one has to experience what Shaima went through.
  We need to pass comprehensive immigration reform so that people like 
Maria and Eusebio can come out of the shadows.
  Mr. Speaker--for every case like Maria's or Shaima's there are dozens 
more left unresolved.
  Countless families have been left in limbo, unsure if or when they 
will ever see their loved ones again.
  Not only do we owe it to these families to fix our broken immigration 
system--we owe it to the country and the constitution to live up to 
American values.
                        


Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an organization 
that has done tremendous work both locally and on the global stage for 
10 remarkable years now, The AFYA Foundation.
  The vision for AFYA began to take shape in a tent in the Serengeti. 
It was 2008, and AFYA's founder, Danielle Butin, was in Tanzania. She 
saw a woman sitting in a tent crying, who said, ``I am a highly sought-
after physician from London, I took a month off from my practice to 
come here to volunteer and work in medical clinics. But they have 
nothing . . . absolutely nothing. I cannot save children from malaria 
because there are no meds or IV bags of fluids. People come in with 
infected wounds, and I have nothing to treat them with.'' In that 
moment, Danielle was compelled to take action. She returned home and 
immediately put her familiarity with and experience in New York City 
healthcare to use--cold calling hospitals and asking about materials 
that are discarded. In January 2008 she launched AFYA, which means 
``health'' or ``wellness'' in Swahili.
  Almost immediately, hospitals started donating supplies. Since they 
didn't have a warehouse to store the equipment and supplies, a semi-
trailer sat for three weeks outside her home in Westchester County. 
These humble beginnings are what grew 10 years later into an 
organization with a staff of 14, 3,000 volunteers annually, and a 
17,000 square foot warehouse in Yonkers.
  Today, AFYA continues to serve those in need with the same compassion 
that inspired its vision ten years ago on the African savannah. As the 
Congressman representing Yonkers and the Ranking Democrat on the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee, I couldn't be prouder of the work they have 
done and continue to do. I want to congratulate Danielle and the entire 
AFYA team on ten remarkable years and thank them for all they have done 
to better our community and world.



Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor a civic organization in 
Yonkers that this year is celebrating a remarkable milestone--the 
Yonkers Chamber of Commerce. 2018 will mark 125 years for the Chamber, 
which for well over a century now has worked to improve economic 
development in the region while building and promoting the city of 
Yonkers.
  The Chamber's legacy of service began, officially, on May 1, 1893 
when William F. Cochran, a leading Yonkers businessman, entered the old 
City Court Room and rapped his gavel to officially sanction what was to 
become a tradition to the local business community. The Yonkers Board 
of Trade was born. A number of prominent citizens, fifty-two to be 
exact, gathered to sanction what would later become Yonkers' leading 
business organization.
  A decade later, the Board of Trade continued to address issues of 
concern and helped establish a visible and viable business community. 
In 1903 the decision was made to form a Chamber of Commerce, and the 
process to make this a reality was put into place. On December 8, 1913, 
the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce officially became the 325th certified 
member of the United States Chamber of Commerce.
  The Chamber of Commerce has served as the guardian and advocate of 
business, and works to foster a healthy relationship with government to 
establish programs designed to enhance business opportunities and 
attract new commercial establishments to the city. The Chamber of 
Commerce represents a diversified membership of retail, industry, 
professionals and service organizations, etc. from major corporations 
to ``mom and pop'' stores. Each member is treated with the same respect 
and concern, regardless of size.
  Today, the mission of the Yonkers Chamber of Commerce ``to serve, 
build and promote a progressive city'' is alive and well. 
Congratulations to the entire Yonkers Chamber of Commerce Board, 
leadership, and membership on reaching this remarkable milestone.
                        


Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, on December 21, 2018, I experienced technical 
difficulties with the electronic voting machine on the House floor, and 
my vote for S. 3628, the National Flood Insurance Program Extension 
Act, was not recorded. My intention was to vote yea for roll call No. 
500.
                        


Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I want to honor a dear friend who has made 
such a remarkable impact in our community for more than 40 years, 
Reverend Dr. Keith Elijah Thompson of Bronx Miracle Gospel Tabernacle 
Word of Faith Ministries.
  Many have referred to Rev. Thompson as the ``Man in the Community'' 
due to his four decades of service to the northeast Bronx. After a 
successful career as an entrepreneur, he answered the call from God and 
entered full-time ministry in 1980. From the inception of the ministry, 
Rev. Thompson integrated a holistic approach, giving special attention 
to the Tripartite nature of human beings to establish communication 
beyond the confines of church. Starting out as a simple storefront, 
Bronx Miracle Gospel Tabernacle World grew by leaps and bounds. In 1993 
the Church moved locations to accommodate the growing congregation. Now 
located on Burke Avenue, the church began to expand further into the 
community through a series of outreach programs including GED and 
college prep courses, in addition to Missions and radio outreach.
  Rev. Thompson was also instrumental in spearheading several other 
high-profile community initiatives and groups, including the Clergy 
Coalition of the 47th Precinct and the White Plains Road/Burke Avenue 
Merchant Association. He also served as Dean of El Shaddai Christian 
School, Vice President of the 49th Precinct Clergy Council, member of 
the 47th Precinct Community Council, and has been active with Bronx 
Community Board 12 and the Williamsbridge and Bronx branches of the 
NAACP. As Chancellor of the Bronx Resource Community Center, which he 
helped form, Rev. Thompson oversaw a facility that provided high school 
equivalency diplomas, job training, and basic computer training to the 
community.
  In October 2014 Bronx Miracle Gospel Tabernacle World moved once 
again to accommodate growing membership. The move has allowed Rev. 
Thompson to further expand services, which now include Back to School 
Festivals and clothing donation distribution.
  Rev. Thompson has accomplished so much for his congregants and for 
the entire northeast Bronx community as a whole. This year, Bronx 
Miracle Gospel Tabernacle World is celebrating his 38th Pastoral 
Anniversary. On this wonderful occasion, I want to congratulate Rev. 
Thompson and thank him for the wonderful work he and his ministries 
continue to do.

Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life of my 
constituent and neighbor, Mr. Thomas Charles Braun. A beloved artist, 
activist, family man, and small business owner, Mr. Braun passed away 
in October 2018. I join my neighbors in recognizing the tremendous 
gifts he gave to our community.
  Born in Lake City, Minnesota, Mr. Braun was always an artistic and 
passionate person. After getting his degree in theater from Lawrence 
University, Mr. Braun taught theater at Lea College, Ekerd College, and 
Normandale Community College. He inspired countless young adults 
through his commitment to fun and daring productions before he left 
academia to run Wild Rumpus in Minneapolis in 1988.
  Consistently recognized as one of the most inventive bookstores 
nationwide, Wild Rumpus is symbolic of the type of person Mr. Braun 
was--open and inviting, passionate about having fun, and always up for 
trying something new and mischievous. Under his devoted management, the 
store garnered national awards, including being named Bookstore of the 
Year by Publisher's Weekly in 2017. As described in his obituary, `One 
never really ``worked for'' Tom. Rather, you became a co-conspirator in 
his sense of mischief and philosophy of ``why not?'' '
  But Mr. Braun was passionate not only about light-hearted ventures. 
He founded Linden Hills Power & Light, an organization that fights for 
climate action on the grassroots level. They were a key constituency 
pushing for citywide door-to-door compost collection, spearheading the 
first pilot program with the City of Minneapolis and Hennepin County. 
Mr. Braun's drive to model the world he wanted to see through his own 
choices and actions was a driving force for some of our most important 
city-wide sustainability efforts.
  Though Mr. Braun is no longer with us, the impact he has made on our 
community will be visible for years to come. I am grateful that he gave 
us so much of his energy and vision, and that he created lasting 
organizations that will continue to model his commitment to being a 
good person, doing right by his neighbors, and fighting for a better 
world. I thank Mr. Braun for all that he has given to Minnesota.
                        


Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Speaker, on December 21, I was not present due to the 
death of my brother two days prior. Had I been present, I would have 
voted ``yea'' on roll call votes 474, 475, 476, 477, 478, 479, 480, 
481, 482, 483, 484, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493, 495, 496, 
499, and 500. I would have voted ``nay'' on roll call votes 485, 494, 
497, and 498.

honoree. Congratulations to Taryn.
                        


Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to call attention to 
President Trump's recent decisions to withdraw or threaten U.S. 
withdrawal from four treaties: the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces 
Treaty, INF Treaty; the Universal Postal Union, UPU, treaty; the 
Optional Protocol to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 
``VCDR Option Protocol''; and the Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations 
and Consular Rights between the United States and Iran, ``Treaty of 
Amity''. The President made these decisions without notice or 
meaningful consultation with the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, 
the congressional committee charged with responsibility and 
jurisdiction over treaties.
  As the ranking member of that committee, I am compelled to 
strenuously object to the manner in which the President has acted, but 
all Senators should protest, regardless of their views on the substance 
of the respective agreements. The President's actions erode the 
constitutional powers of this body and our institutional prerogatives.
  Article 2 of the Constitution endows the President and the Senate 
with shared power over treaties. The President, it states, ``shall have 
power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make 
treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.''
  While the Constitution does not expressly dictate a procedure for 
terminating treaty relationships, Senators have long asserted that the 
shared treaty power extends to withdrawal and therefore also requires 
Senate advice and consent. Even though the executive branch may not 
agree with this position, what is unacceptable is that Senators are 
first learning about these withdrawals online or in the newspaper 
instead of through proactive outreach by and meaningful dialogue with 
the executive branch.
  President Trump has regrettably shown exceedingly little respect for 
the Constitution and for the institutional prerogatives of this body. I 
stand today to highlight one area in which he has actively undermined 
the Senate's constitutional role and authority. I plan to do everything 
in my power to protect the Senate's role and responsibilities over 
treaties and urge all of my colleagues to join in this effort.
                        


Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my honor to pay tribute to 
Fort Sill in Oklahoma in preparation of this great military 
installation's 150th anniversary on January 8, 2019. For 150 years, 
Fort Sill has played a critical role in our national defense, from an 
outpost to prevent border raids, to today as the home of the Fires 
Center of Excellence and Basic Combat Training site. The history of 
Fort Sill can be traced back to January 8, 1869, when Major General 
Philip H. Sheridan staked out the site of Fort Sill in a campaign into 
Indian Territory to prevent border settlements from being raided in 
Texas and Kansas. The garrison was initially named Camp Wichita and was 
later renamed after Brigadier General Joshua W. Sill, in honor of 
General Sheridan's West Point classmate and friend who was killed 
during the American Civil War.
  The first post commander was Brevet Major General Benjamin Grierson, 
and the first Indian agent was Colonel Albert Gallatin Boone, grandson 
of Daniel Boone. The last Indian lands in Oklahoma opened for 
settlement in 1901, and 29,000 homesteaders registered at Fort Sill 
during July for the land lottery. On August 6, 1901, the town of Lawton 
was established and quickly grew to become the third largest city in 
Oklahoma and was later renamed Lawton-Fort Sill.
  With the disappearance of the frontier, the mission of Fort Sill 
gradually changed from cavalry to field artillery as the first 
artillery battery arrived at Fort Sill in 1902, and the last cavalry 
regiment departed in May 1907. In 1917, the Henry Post Army Airfield 
was constructed for artillery observation and spotting. The School of 
Fire for the Field Artillery was founded at Fort Sill in 1911 and 
continues to operate today as the world-renowned U.S. Army Field 
Artillery School. At various historic times, Fort Sill has also served 
as home to the Infantry School of Musketry, the School for Aerial 
Observers, the Artillery Officers Candidate School--Robinson Barracks--
the Air Service Flying School, and the Army Aviation School. Fort Sill 
is the birthplace of military combat aviation, 1st Aero Squadron. It is 
home to Henry Post Army Airfield, the oldest airfield in the Army. In 
August 1917, Captain H.R. Eyrich surveyed a new airfield location at 
Fort Sill and established the airfield, which is named after Second 
Lieutenant Henry D. Post.
  Fort Sill remains the only Active Army installation of all the forts 
on the South Plains built during the Indian Wars and was designated as 
a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Fort Sill serves as home of the 
U.S. Army Field Artillery School; the U.S. Army Air Defense Artillery 
School; the 428th Field Artillery Training Brigade; the 30th Air 
Defense Artillery Training Brigade; the 434th Field Artillery Basic 
Combat Training Brigade; the Marine Corps Field Artillery Military 
Occupational Specialty school, the 75th (Forces Command) Fires Brigade; 
and the 31st (Forces Command) Air Defense Artillery Brigade.
  Thousands of soldiers and marines have been trained for service in 
the field artillery at Fort Sill. Notable alumni include President 
Harry S. Truman, who during World War I became the commander of Company 
D, 129th Field Artillery, entering combat in the last few months of the 
war, moving his horse-drawn battery to engage the enemy and supporting 
the infantry, firing his last shot on the day of the armistice.
  It is also important to recognize the positive impact and 
connectivity of the Lawton-Fort Sill relationship. The connection 
between the community and the military installation is what makes Fort 
Sill so unique and successful. The community members and 
representatives are equally responsible for the rich history and 
successes of Fort Sill. Based on exemplary community support and 
vision, Fort Sill has actually benefited from five rounds of Base 
Realignment and Closure. Through these five rounds, the mission and 
importance of Fort Sill has increased. This highlights the fact that 
Fort Sill is more than just a military installation, for 150 years Fort 
Sill has been a part of the community.
  As Fort Sill turns 150, the senior leadership at the installation 
represent the long history of high-caliber military personnel who have 
set foot at Fort Sill. I would like to recognize the following 
personnel: the Fires Center of Excellence and Fort Sill commanding 
general MG Wilson Shoffner, Jr.; Fires Center of Excellence CSM John W. 
Folley; Fort Sill garrison commander COL Don A. King, Jr.; Fires Center 
of Excellence Field Artillery School commandant BG Stephen G. Smith; 
and Fires Center of Excellence Air Defense Artillery School commandant 
BG Brian W. Gibson.
  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I want to 
congratulate Fort Sill on 150 successful years and thank the men and 
women who have served their nation while assigned to Fort Sill for 
their continued commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to this great 
Nation.<bullet>
                        


Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate completes its business today, it adjourn to then convene for pro 
forma session only with no business being conducted on Thursday, 
January 3, at 11:50 a.m. and that the Senate adjourn until it next 
convenes at 12 noon on Thursday, January 3, pursuant to the 
Constitution; further, that following the prayer and pledge and 
following the presentation of the certificates of election and the 
swearing in of elected Members and the required live quorum, the 
morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved 
to date, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use 
later in the day; and further, that following leader remarks, the 
Senate be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to 
speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.
                        


Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I was unable to have my votes recorded on the 
House floor from Wednesday, December 19 through Friday, December 21, 
2018. Had I been present, I would have supported all bills considered 
under a suspension of the rules, with the following exceptions:
   I would have voted no on S. 1934 as I feel that it is important that 
environmental standards in remote areas must be strengthened whenever 
possible to preserve natural landscapes.
   I would have voted against H.R. 7388. While I support long term 
reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program, I feel that it is 
important to avoid any lapse in the program to ensure continuity for 
homeowners and those looking to purchase a home. To that end, this bill 
would have been counterproductive by creating uncertainty about the 
NFIP by sending the extension back to the Senate at the 11th hour.
   I would also like to add a few comments on a couple bills that I 
would have supported:
   In particular, as an original cosponsor of the Codifying Useful 
Regulatory Definitions (CURD) Act, I would have voted yes on final 
passage of S. 2322. This bill would give real Wisconsin cheese makers 
the certainty they need to produce a special natural product.
   I also would have voted yes on the Space Frontier Act of 2018, 
despite serious concerns about process. Just as Ranking Member of the 
House Science, Space, and Technology Committee Bernice Johnson stated 
on the floor, I support NASA's mission and thus would have supported 
this bill.
   Additionally, I would have opposed the following bills considered 
under a rule:
   I would have voted against H.R. 88. A $100 billion boondoggle, H.R. 
88 would have arbitrarily extended some important credits but not 
others, leave some communities suffering from disasters out in the cold 
and inject unnecessary social politics into our tax code. As I said on 
the floor on November 29th, the first time this bill was brought to the 
floor, I would have opposed the package.
   I would have voted against H.R. 695, as amended. Rather than 
providing pay for dedicated public servants over the holidays, 
particularly TSA agents working to protect Americans traveling to see 
loved ones over the holidays, House leadership rejected a unanimous 
agreement in the Senate to keep the government open. Instead, they 
passed a blatantly partisan package that had no chance of passage in 
the Senate and virtually ensured a government shutdown.
                        


Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize Sheriff Keith Royal, 
who is retiring from the Nevada County Sheriff's Office after more than 
40 years in law enforcement.
   Sheriff Royal is a life-long public servant dedicated to protecting 
and serving his community. His father Kenneth, a Deputy with the 
Sacramento County Sheriff's Office, was killed in the line of duty 
while attempting to apprehend a robbery suspect. His two brothers, Ken 
and Patrick, and nephew Steven all served in the Sacramento County 
Sheriff's Office, where his son-in-law Jeff is currently a Deputy.
   Keith was born and raised in Northern California and remains an 
active member of his community. After graduating from Cal State 
Sacramento with a degree in Criminal Justice, he served as a California 
DMV Investigator, shortly after which he began training at the 
Sacramento Sheriff's Academy. As an Executive Lieutenant, he served in 
various roles with the Sacramento Sheriff's Office, including as a Jail 
Manager, Reserve Coordinator, and Vice Detail.
   First elected as Nevada County Sheriff in 1998, Royal's leadership 
led to an overall drop in the crime rate. He worked to modernize the 
dispatch center, expand the Neighborhood Watch and Volunteer programs, 
and establish the School Resource Officer Program. Additionally, 
Sheriff Royal amassed $8 million in special revenue funds for the 
Sheriff's Office, implemented computerized jail management and high-
band radio systems, and obtained a new evidence facility and DNA lab. 
During this time, he also served as President of the California State 
Sheriffs' Association, and as Chair of its Undersheriff's Committee.
   These are just a handful of the things that Sheriff Royal was able 
to accomplish over his tenure, which has created a safer and more 
prosperous community for the residents of Nevada County.
   Having been the second-longest serving Sheriff in the history of 
Nevada County, Sheriff Royal is now ready to spend more time with his 
daughters and granddaughters. Along with teaching them to fish, he 
hopes to spend time maintaining his garden, golfing, and enjoying some 
much-needed down time.
   Sheriff Royal's service has left a lasting impact on Nevada County, 
and I thank him for his service and wish him the best in his future 
endeavors.
                        


Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating the Hermann Bearcats Volleyball team for 
winning the 2018 Missouri Class 2 State Volleyball Championship.
   This team and Coach Linda Lampkin should be commended for all of 
their hard work throughout this past year and for bringing home the 
state championship to their school and community.
   I ask you to join me in recognizing the Hermann Bearcats Volleyball 
team for a job well done.
                        


Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, as a member of the House Agriculture 
Committee and a member of the Farm Bill Conference Committee, I am 
pleased that the Conference report will strengthen the existing SNAP 
Employment and Training program by facilitating better connections 
between existing workforce development efforts and employers in local 
communities. Specifically, conferees rejected the one-size-fits-all 
approach to training programs that H.R. 2 had initially adopted, as 
these programs have consistently proven to be ineffective--too often 
failing to match low-income adults with the types of training and job 
opportunities they need. Instead, the Farm Bill conference report 
supports collaboration between workforce development programs and 
employers already tackling this job in their communities to better 
serve SNAP participants--a win for both participants and for local 
employers.
  I am also pleased that the Conference report includes several 
provisions that will improve the types of programs that SNAP employment 
and training can provide. The conference report reinforces the 
requirement that states properly assess clients and assign them to 
programs appropriate to their needs and skills. It also recognizes the 
important role case management services can play in helping to address 
barriers to work by requiring states to provide these types of 
services. Additionally, conferees prioritized the funding of innovative 
employment and training pilot programs, including pilot programs that 
serve specific groups with known barriers to work. These types of smart 
investments will have a
demonstrated impact on improving client outcomes, as opposed to 
spending billions on the creation of large new bureaucracies to track 
monthly work tests for millions of SNAP participants as the House 
passed bill would have done.
  I am also pleased that the conferees address a long-standing 
problem--when a SNAP participant is referred to a training program, and 
the program determines that the services they provide are not well 
matched to the needs of the participant. States have long been required 
to do meaningful assessments in order to properly assign clients. We 
believe the expanded investment in case management should improve this 
capacity. And, this bill emphasized that reassessment is important as 
well. But sometimes, when the state refers someone to a local training 
provider the provider--after doing their own assessment--determines 
that their services aren't appropriate for the individual. Under 
current law, that leaves the individual out of luck and even at risk of 
losing SNAP benefits and wastes the time and services of the training 
provider. The bill and report make clear that states must reassess and 
reassign the participant if appropriate. Participants will no longer 
lose benefits because states are doing a poor job of assigning them to 
programs that don't work for them.
  The primary role of employment and training programs should always be 
to transition people to sustained self-reliance rather than to find 
reasons to cut them off from benefits.
                          



Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating the Eureka Wildcats Volleyball team for 
winning the 2018 Missouri Class 4 State Volleyball Championship.
   This team and Coach Jodie Fowler should be commended for all of 
their hard work throughout this past year and for bringing home the 
state championship to their school and community.
   I ask you to join me in recognizing the Eureka Wildcats Volleyball 
team for a job well done.
                        


Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of myself and Mr. Brady of 
Pennsylvania, the Ranking Member of the Committee on House 
Administration, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize 
Thomas G. Hungar for his distinguished service as General Counsel to 
the House of Representatives.
  Drawing on his mastery of constitutional law and broad litigation 
experience, Mr. Hungar has provided thoughtful and effective legal 
advice to Members, Committees, and staff on a host of legal matters, 
without regard to political affiliation. As the House's top lawyer, Mr. 
Hungar has employed his considerable expertise and sound judgment to 
protect and strengthen the institutional prerogatives of the House, 
rightfully earning him the respect and admiration of the entire House 
community.
  Of particular importance to the Committee on House Administration, 
Mr. Hungar has skillfully counseled the Committee's Members and staff 
on a wide range of significant matters with far-reaching institutional 
implications. Mr. Hungar has also been a trusted advisor to the Chief 
Administrative Officer of the House. Mr. Hungar has been a source of 
tremendous leadership and legal advice to the Committee and the House.
  On behalf of the Members of the Committee on House Administration and 
the Committee staff, we thank Mr. Hungar for his service to the House 
and wish him the very best as he takes the next step in his illustrious 
career.
                        


Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise, along with Hank Johnson, 
Chair of the Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the 
Internet; and Sheila Jackson Lee, Chair of the Subcommittee on Crime, 
Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations--to thank Jason 
Everett for nearly a decade of service to the House Judiciary 
Committee.
  Growing up in Alexandria, Virginia, Jason attended college at Duke 
University and law school at William and Mary, before returning to the 
Washington, D.C. area. He began his career on Capitol Hill as a 
Legislative Aide to Senator Barbara Boxer, and he later worked for 
Congressman Mel Watt as a Legislative Assistant covering Judiciary 
Committee issues. He joined the House Judiciary Committee in 2009 as a 
Counsel, working on intellectual property and other issues, and he 
later rose to become Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on Courts, 
Intellectual Property, and the Internet, as well as a Deputy Chief 
Counsel of the Full Committee, overseeing the Intellectual Property and 
Crime Subcommittees.
  As Chief Counsel of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee, Jason was 
responsible for handling highly complex patent, copyright, trademark, 
and courts issues, among other matters. Many Members and staff relied 
heavily on his ability to explain, in a clear and understandable 
manner, the often complicated and highly technical matters that moved 
through his Subcommittee. He also deftly balanced his substantive 
expertise with a keen appreciation of the various stakeholders' 
interests in each issue, and an ability to find consensus among these 
sometimes divergent interests.
  Jason's efforts were vital to enacting significant reforms to the 
intellectual property ecosystem that will promote innovation and 
protect the creative community. For example, he worked tirelessly to 
pass the Defend Trade Secrets Act, which helps firms keep proprietary 
information--which, if disclosed, could be ruinous to them--from being 
made public. This legislation will save the American economy many 
billions of dollars, and preserve many thousands of jobs.
  Jason was also a critical player in the Committee's lengthy review of 
the Copyright laws, leading to passage of the Music Modernization Act, 
historic bipartisan legislation to reform the music licensing system. 
He spent countless hours working with a vast array of stakeholders to 
craft legislation that will better serve music creators and digital 
music providers, and ultimately consumers. He was also instrumental in 
passing legislation to promote greater diversity among patent holders, 
passing legislation to ensure that visually impaired individuals have 
access to published works, and developing hearings to oversee the 
implementation of the America Invents Act.
  In each of these matters, Jason not only worked with various parties 
to achieve consensus, but he also worked closely with his Republican 
counterparts to find a bipartisan solution. Jason's cooperative spirit 
and excellent sense of humor helped pave the way for legislation that 
ultimately garnered near unanimous support.
  In addition to Jason's work on the Intellectual Property 
Subcommittee, as a Deputy Chief Counsel for the Full Committee, he also 
worked closely with his colleagues on the Crime Subcommittee. In this 
role, he helped navigate many thorny issues in pursuit of criminal 
justice reform, and his efforts paid off with passage of the First Step 
Act. He has also been involved in a range of other criminal justice 
issues, such as the Violence Against Women Act and gun safety.
  Jason is universally well-liked and respected among Democrats and 
Republicans, Members and staff, both on the Hill and off. His positive 
attitude and hard work will be greatly missed by everyone who worked 
with him, but we wish him all the best in his future endeavors, and we 
thank him for his service to the Judiciary Committee, to the Congress, 
and to the country.
                          



Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is with a deep sentiment of 
gratitude that I rise today to recognize Barbara Angus, Chief Tax 
Counsel for the Ways and Means Committee, as she departs our Committee 
staff.
  Whenever I travel Texas and the country, folks often ask me when I 
knew that tax reform was going to be a reality. Without a doubt, that 
moment hit me when Barbara interviewed for the position of Chief Tax 
Counsel.
  Holding degrees from two Ivy League Institutions, and with decades of 
experience at the Treasury Department and within the private sector, 
few in Washington match Barbara's intelligence, leadership, and work 
ethic. Barbara understands our tax code almost better than anyone else. 
Which is why she understood that it was time for a rewrite, to get rid 
of its uncompetitive and unfair nature.
  Mr. Speaker, Barbara's efforts changed history. With her guidance and 
expertise, we were able to create a tax code that finally works for 
families and Main Street businesses.
  For the first time in over 30 years, we did what many said was 
impossible. We lowered rates while broadening the base; we closed 
special-interest loopholes that riddled the system for far too long; we 
gave families first say over their hard-earned money; and we gave our 
job creators a tax code that allows them to compete and win here at 
home instead of abroad. None of this would have been possible without 
Barbara Angus.
  On behalf of our entire Committee, I want to say thank you to Barbara 
for her three years of service to the people's House. I am so thankful 
for her guidance and friendship. My Chairmanship has been benefited 
greatly because of Barbara and it has been an honor to work with her.
  We wish her all the best as she moves on to the next chapter of her 
storied career. Barbara will be missed dearly by our Committee staff, 
and she will always be part of our Ways and Means family.
                        


Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the work of the 
Congressional Black Caucus during the 115th Congress.
  The Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) spent the 115th Congress 
fighting against attempts to return this country to darker days by 
being fearless in telling our truth. Black Americans, who helped build 
the very Capitol in which we stand, are once again witnessing our own 
government set the wheels in motion to turn against us. This Congress, 
led by a group of people cozier with the one percent than with the 
forgotten man or woman, has worked with this Presidential 
administration to turn back the clock. The CBC has stood up for our 
values time and time again to say that we will not go back to those 
dark days. We have been unrelenting in standing against this tide and 
will not shy away from this battle.
  The CBC has worked tirelessly to infuse morality into the legislative 
debates during the 115th Congress and perform tireless oversight into 
the harmful policies of this Presidential administration. Since this 
President took office, he has led efforts to reverse substantive 
policies that have helped black Americans and failed to stem the tide 
of hatred and racism that made a strong resurgence during this divisive 
tenure. The lack of moral leadership has endangered disenfranchised 
communities and policy decisions have eroded critical economic, health 
and education programming. The Caucus has taken every opportunity to 
lift every voice to object to hurtful and immoral lawmaking while 
engaging the public in conversations about the stakes we were facing.
  The CBC had to fight for our values from the earliest days of this 
Congress, with an incoming President nominating a number of unqualified 
people to lead his cabinet agencies, including then Senator Jefferson 
Beauregard Sessions, who the President wanted to appoint to the 
Department of Justice. I represented the Caucus alongside my colleagues 
Senator Booker and living legend Representative John Lewis in speaking 
out against Sessions' lifetime of support for troubling policies that 
impeded the progress of black Americans.
  The President wasted no time in partnering with his allies in this 
Congress to advance an agenda that carried water for billionaires while 
ignoring the nation' s most vulnerable citizens. The Caucus once again 
reprised its role as the Conscience of the Congress by opposing this 
Congress and this White House as they worked in concert to attack 
vulnerable communities by neutering programming that served them.
  When the White House planned a national voter suppression and 
intimidation effort, the Congressional Black Caucus criticized the 
Administration's sham ``Voter Integrity Commission'' for seeking to 
solve a voter fraud issue that was clearly non-existent. In a few short 
weeks, the states themselves rose up against this effort and it 
mercifully perished due to a strong resistance against its undemocratic 
underpinnings. When the President demonstrated an uncomfortable 
coziness with Russian operatives the Caucus performed oversight. When 
the Department of Justice re-energized the war on drugs the Caucus 
stood firm in its opposition to restoring policies that unfairly 
targeted black citizens in law enforcement activity feeding an 
unsustainable mass incarceration machine. When the President asked the 
Caucus and black communities ``What the Hell do You Have to Lose'', the 
Caucus went to the White House with a 130 page policy document 
educating this President about issues facing black America. We provided 
dozens of policy options that a serious White House could have 
leveraged to improve the lives of Americans of all colors who face 
challenges. We haven't heard back.
  The CBC responded to the White House's immoral budget request with 
its own budget, infused with morality and justice. The Caucus' budget 
proposal invested in education, jobs and healthcare while asking the 
wealthiest among us to pay their fair share. The budget received strong 
support in a floor vote and we are going to continue to introduce 
spending plans that invest in the important things in this nation in a 
responsible fashion.
  The CBC stood up against the injustice sought by this Congress when 
it planned to cut taxes for billionaires while robbing health care from 
struggling families. This crisis of morality in Congress was compounded 
by an administration that was sabotaging affordable health care at 
every turn. Facing a moral crisis and the potential for enduring pain, 
the CBC called on everyone to think twice before hurting tens of 
millions of Americans. We raised our voices against the injustice of 
failing to invest in new jobs for hard working Americans while Congress 
handed corporate giants billions of dollars in tax breaks. All the 
while the President sought historic cuts to programs that seniors, 
children and families rely on to live. We have pointed out repeatedly 
that these morally bankrupt policies will also endanger the country, 
impairing future investments in our human capital and other important 
resources to all of our eventual detriment.
  The CBC has been actively fighting against a steady stream of 
increased hate crimes and public racism. When this President failed to 
condemn white supremacists and Nazis, the CBC called for racists to be 
purged from this White House, and within weeks, most of the most odious 
and hateful people around the President were gone. We also called for 
white supremacist figures to be purged from Congressional spaces and 
for Confederate symbols and statues to be removed. We have also 
continued to fight for a more fair criminal justice system that gives 
ex-offenders a second chance while holding wayward police departments 
accountable for unconstitutional policing practices. Our members have 
been on the front lines of pushing for deserving non-violent offenders 
to re-enter our community and for police departments to restore 
humanity to their interactions with our neighborhoods.
  When the FBI made up a new term to describe politically engaged black 
Americans, ``black identity extremists'', the Caucus spoke truth to 
power, meeting with FBI Director Christopher Wray to demand that the 
FBI provide more insights into the origins of this harmful term and 
explain how it might impact their investigations. We made it clear that 
we expected the FBI to not target Americans simply due to their 
physical characteristics and political views. This felt like a 
throwback to an earlier, darker period in our history, when the FBI 
surveilled black Americans it found objectionable. We told Director 
Wray that the CBC would not stand for a COINTELPRO 2.0 and that his 
investigations needed to be done absent the stain of a poorly worded 
term such as ``black identity extremist''. The Caucus also repeatedly 
stood up against inept and unqualified attorneys and jurists being 
offered up for lifetime appointments to the federal judiciary. Thanks 
in large part to the work of the Caucus, some of the most horrific 
institutional racists are not on the bench today. And this will stand 
as a testament to the work of the Caucus infusing morality into the 
deliberations of legislators in this Capitol.
  When African and Caribbean countries were disrespectfully referenced 
by being called ``shithole countries'' the Caucus called for those 
remarks to be censured. At the first state of the union, this Caucus 
stared the hateful policies in the face and showed the
world that we would not let a hurtful administration impose an ounce of 
fear upon us.
  In addition to performing robust oversight, this Caucus set out to 
introduce legislation that would protect vulnerable communities while 
investing in the future. Our members put significant work into 
addressing a host of issues that would improve outcomes for black 
families and for all Americans that yearn for better. The Caucus' 1300-
page bill, the Jobs and Justice Act of 2018, is a blueprint for serious 
legislators that want to bring change to this country in an inclusive 
way. I hope that the next Congress leverages the work this Caucus has 
done by implementing much of the bill in the important legislation that 
is to come.
  This Caucus also worked to hold corporate America accountable for 
ensuring that all of America was represented in its ranks and to ensure 
that their businesses were not being leveraged to harm communities of 
color. We called on the largest companies and investors in America to 
diversity their boards, c-suites and supply chains. We also called on 
powerful social media companies to invest in more diverse workforces to 
better identify attempts to weaponize platforms to inflame racial 
tensions. In addition, we called on technology companies to better 
address implicit bias in the development of new artificial intelligence 
tools to ensure that these new tools demonstrated more promise than 
peril.
  When the history books are written, this Congress will be cited as a 
failure. Instead of serving as a constitutional check and balance 
against a historically corrupt President with repressive instincts, 
this Republican led Congress enabled and emboldened an unqualified 
executive to run roughshod over civil liberties and the rights of 
underserved and struggling communities. It is no surprise that several 
members of this Caucus have been some of the earliest voices to examine 
whether the constitutional remedy of impeachment is an appropriate tool 
to address the dangers this President poses to our republic. This 
Congress has been an embarrassment and has failed American families 
time and time again.
  But like a phoenix rising, Americans have chosen a different 
direction. The House of Representatives will be under new leadership in 
just a few short days, ushering in a new era of oversight and morally 
infused legislating with members of the CBC in key positions to deliver 
better outcomes for Americans of all kinds from all races and from all 
parties. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus are members of the 
human race who care for their fellow man and woman. We come from 
communities that have been long forgotten over the broad sweep of 
American history. These same communities have bred hope and promise 
during these same times. Our optimism and faith has never wavered, even 
at the darkest times. We have come this far by faith. And we have miles 
left to go before we sleep. The members of this Caucus will continue to 
lead in the debates that matter.
  It has been an honor to serve as the chairman of this incredible 
group of legislators. I pray that in our service, the 48 members of 
this bi-partisan, bi-cameral caucus have made our ancestors proud and 
our constituents eager to continue to work with us to advance the 
interests of all communities that seek to be led by men and women of 
conscience. We walk in the footsteps of our ancestors and have not yet 
completed the journeys that they started when they were first forced 
off overcrowded slave ships onto the shores of this nation. This has 
been an imperfect union, but it is one that is worth fighting to 
preserve.
  As I yield the chairmanship of the CBC to incoming chair Karen Bass 
of California, I wish her strength and resolve for the fights to come. 
I pray the Lord will guide her steps to continue the work of our 
ancestors and the work of the 13 Founders of the CBC, who came together 
in 1971 to raise their voices to confront the massive challenges that 
faced them at that time. Many of our challenges are the same though the 
times have changed around us. I know that Representative Bass will 
continue to lead this Caucus with intelligence, integrity and courage. 
I wish her well and I thank my colleagues for the opportunity to serve 
them as chairman.
  Mr. Speaker, I celebrate the Congressional Black Caucus during the 
115th Congress.

Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the 115th 
Congress. While I am disappointed that the current spending impasse 
could not be resolved this Congress, I am hopeful that we will remedy 
our current predicament after the swearing-in of the new Democratic 
majority. The historic House takeover by a once-in-a-generation 
incoming Democratic class of lawmakers is nothing short of inspiring. I 
wish them all the luck in the world.
  This Congress, Mr. Speaker, it was an honor to be named the 8th Most 
Effective Democrat in the House by the Center for Effective Lawmaking 
at the University of Virginia. It was also an honor to receive 100 
percent ratings from the ACLU, the Human Rights Campaign, and Planned 
Parenthood. I am proud of the fact that, according to Govtrack, the 
legislation I introduced in 2017--we are still awaiting the results for 
2018--placed me in the top 10 percent of all Members with respect to 
the number of cosponsors secured, and the top 20 percent of all Members 
with respect to the number of bipartisan cosponsors secured.
  Additionally, Mr. Speaker, it was also a pleasure serving on the 
House Appropriations Committee this Congress, particularly under the 
leadership of my good friend, Ranking Member Lowey. The work that went 
into crafting legislation totaling more than $1.2 trillion in 
discretionary spending each year was staggering, as was my own learning 
curve on my two subcommittees--the Commerce, Justice, Science 
Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations. 
Drafting measures on those subcommittees that accounted for a combined 
$109 billion in discretionary federal spending each year was an 
unforgettable experience, as was securing $1.4 billion for personal 
spending priorities.
  I would like to take this opportunity to include in the Record some 
of the legislative
achievements that were signed into law this Congress as the result of 
work performed by my office on behalf of the people of the Sixth 
Congressional District of New York:
       1) H.R. 423, the ``Anti-Spoofing Act of 2017'', which 
     criminalizes acts of spoofing (the practice of disguising

     Public Law 115-254, the ``FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018'' 
     (submitted as amendment no. 65 to H.R. 4 to the House Rules 
     Committee).
       5) H.R. 754, the ``Anwar Sadat Centennial Celebration 
     Act'', which I co-authored with Rep. Chris Stewart from Utah, 
     awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to Anwar Sadat and 
     permitted it to be presented to his widow, Jehan Sadat, and a 
     representative of the government of Egypt.
       6) Section 407 of Public Law 115-254, the ``FAA

     Accountability Office to review airlines' training policies 
     for employees and contractors regarding racial, ethnic, and 
     religious nondiscrimination and requires the Secretary of 
     Transportation to develop and disseminate best practices 
     based upon the findings of the report (via amendment no. 37

     established childcare coordinators for military installations 
     (via amendment no. 39 to H.R. 2810).
       11) Section 544 of Public Law 115-91, the ``National

       12) $500 million for U.S.-Israel missile defense programs 
     funded by Section 8070 of Public Law 115-245, the 
     ``Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, 
     and Education Appropriations Act, 2019''. These funds will be 
     used for the Iron Dome defense system, David's Sling system 
     components, and the Arrow-3 system.
       13) $373.8 million for Israeli Cooperative Programs with 
     the U.S. Department of Defense, which appears on page 85D of 
     the Joint Explanatory Statement for Division C of H.R. 1625,

     Entrepreneurial Development Programs provided for on page 233 
     of Public Law 115-141, the ``Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
     2018''. This increase in funding will allow the establishment 
     of a new Small Business Development Center (SBDC) to be 
     opened in New York's Sixth Congressional District.
       16) $90.7 million for programs to combat wildlife 
     trafficking, which appears on page 68 of the Joint

     Spain and on Enewetak Atoll.'' (Incorporated by reference 
     into the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 5895, 
     the ``Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military 
     Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 
     2019''). This provision directs the VA to determine, using 
     scientific and medical data, whether 38 CFR 3.309(d) should 
     be modified in order to allow veterans who participated in 
     nuclear clean-up activities in Palomares, Spain and on 
     Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands to be presumed to be

     on its current research into this rare cancer that appears in 
     Vietnam veterans at higher rates than the general population, 
     and to explain why less than one-third of the claims for 
     service connected disabilities related to the disease have 
     been granted by the VA.
       22) Page 36 of House Report 115-673--``Female medical 
     staff.'' (Incorporated by reference into the Joint 
     Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 5895, the ``Energy 
     and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and 
     Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019''). This provision 
     directs the VA to report to Congress on the number of female 
     health care professionals hired by the Veterans Health 
     Administration each year over the last five years, including 
     information pertaining to job type and employment location, 
     so that additional female health care professionals can be 
     hired in order to provide the growing number of female 
     veterans greater opportunities to choose the gender of their 
     health care provider.
       23) Page 93 of House Report 115-697--``Carbon Capture.'' 
     (Incorporated by reference into the Joint Explanatory 
     Statement accompanying H.R. 5895, the ``Energy and Water, 
     Legislative Branch, and Military Construction and Veterans 
     Affairs Appropriations Act, 2019''). This provision directs 
     the Department of Energy to ``explore carrying out a prize 
     competition to advance the research, development, or 
     commercialization of technologies that capture, sequester, or 
     utilize carbon.''
       24) Page 97 of House Report 115-697--``Energy Information 
     Administration, Puerto Rico.'' (Incorporated by reference 
     into the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 5895, 
     the ``Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military 
     Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act, 
     2019''). This provision urges the Energy Information 
     Administration to publish information for Puerto Rico and 
     other territories in its state profiles section in a manner 
     that is consistent with the information furnished for states.
       25) Page 150 of House Report 115-862--``Free Application 
     for Federal Student Aid.'' (Incorporated by reference into 
     the Joint Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 6157, the 
     ``Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, 
     and Education Appropriations Act, 2019''). This provision 
     encourages the Secretary of Education to translate the Free 
     Application for Federal Student Aid into additional foreign 
     languages.
       26) Page 55 of House Report 115-862--``Gynecologic Cancer 
     Clinical Trials.'' (Incorporated by reference into the Joint 
     Explanatory Statement accompanying H.R. 6157, the 
     ``Department of Defense and Labor, Health and Human Services, 
     and Education Appropriations Act, 2019''). This provision 
     directs the National Cancer Institute to provide Congress 
     with information on access to gynecologic cancer clinical 
     trials in order to increase future access to these life-
     saving trials.
       27) Page 156 of House Report 115-862-''Data for Puerto 
     Rico.'' (Incorporated by reference into the Joint Explanatory 
     Statement accompanying H.R. 6157, the ``Department of Defense 
     and Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education 
     Appropriations Act, 2019''). This provision directs the 
     National Center for Education Statistics to collect and 
     publish data for Puerto Rico in the same manner it collects 
     and publishes data for states so that Puerto Rico has 
     meaningful data that can be used to compare its students' 
     academic progress with students across the rest of the United 
     States.
       28) Page 58 of House Report 115-862--``Hepatitis B (1).''

     Mariana Islands, and other insular areas, and recommends that 
     the CDFI Fund use its Capacity Building Initiative to expand 
     service to these areas.
  Additionally, I am proud to have secured passage of the following 
legislation through the U.S. House of Representatives prior to today, 
and will continue to fight to secure passage of these provisions into 
law in the future:
       1) H.R. 382, the ``100 Years of Women in Congress Act'', 
     which seeks to rename the Women and Minorities in STEM Fields 
     Program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture the ``Jeannette 
     Rankin Women and Minorities in STEM Fields Program'' in honor 
     of the 100 year anniversary of the election of the first 
     woman to Congress--Jeannette Rankin.
       2) Section 1(5) of H.R. 6846, ``To require the United 
     States Postal Service to establish new Zip codes, and for 
     other purposes,'' which would designate a single, unique ZIP 
     Code for Glendale, New York. This section stems from my bill 
     H.R. 803, ``To direct the United States Postal Service to 
     designate a single, unique ZIP Code for Glendale, New York'', 
     an effort that originated with former-Representative, and 
     Vice Presidential candidate, Geraldine Ferraro almost 40 
     years ago.
       3) Section 7(a)(2) of H.R. 6199, ``Restoring Access to 
     Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act of 
     2018'', which would permit the purchase of menstrual hygiene 
     products with health flexible spending accounts.
       4) Section 504 of H.R. 5515, the ``John S. McCain National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019'', which would 
     allow any member of the armed forces who gives birth to be 
     exempt from deployment for up to 12 months following 
     childbirth.
       5) Section 566 of H.R. 5515, the ``John S. McCain National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019'', which would 
     require the Secretary of Defense to permit military parents 
     flexible (non-continuous) maternity and paternity leave, 
     allowing this time off to be spread out over time instead of 
     being used all at once.
       6) Section 717 of H.R. 5515, the ``John S. McCain National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019'', which would 
     authorize the Secretary of Defense to develop a burn patient 
     transfer system. This system would include military and 
     civilian burn centers that could be used in mass casualty 
     events.
       7) Section 220F of H.R. 5515, the ``John S. McCain National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019'', which would 
     authorize the Jet Noise Reduction Program within the U.S. 
     Navy's Office of Naval Research in order to reduce noise 
     produced by high performance military jets.
       8) Section 595 of H.R. 5515, the ``John S. McCain National 
     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019'', which would 
     require the Department of Defense to create exit surveys on 
     attrition levels for members of the military in order to 
     better understand why attrition rates are higher for women 
     than for men.
       9) Section 921(b)(3) of H.R. 5515, the ``John S. McCain 
     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019'', 
     which sought to add oversight responsibilities to the DOD 
     Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Policy and 
     Oversight Council. The newly created Council currently has no 
     oversight requirement in its mandate. The Council will
     be responsible for overseeing the research, development, and 
     deployment of artificial intelligence and autonomous machines 
     used by the military. The provision was cosponsored by Rep. 
     Darren Soto of Florida.
       10) Section 3(a)(7) of H.R. 1638, the ``Iranian Leadership 
     Asset Transparency Act'', which would require an assessment 
     of the effectiveness of U.S. economic sanctions against Iran.
       11) Section 2 of H.R. 1367, ``To improve the authority of 
     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain 
     physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans 
     Affairs and for other purposes'', which would assist the VA 
     Secretary in filling Veterans Health Administration positions 
     for which there are severe staffing shortages. Under current 
     law, the Inspector General (IG) of the VA must issue an 
     annual report on which positions within the agency are 
     severely understaffed. The VA Secretary is then granted 
     expedited hiring authority to fill those positions. This 
     provision would have permitted the IG to report on additional 
     shortages than those currently allowed by law so that the VA 
     Secretary could fill those positions more quickly as well.
       12) Section 13 of H.R. 1367, ``To improve the authority of 
     the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to hire and retain 
     physicians and other employees of the Department of Veterans 
     Affairs and for other purposes'', which would require the 
     Secretary of the VA to establish a program that encourages 
     members of the Armed Forces serving as health professionals 
     to pursue jobs with the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
     upon their discharge or separation from the military.

Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring remembrance to 
a great Iowan--Dale Golightly.
  Dale was a man who loved and worked hard for his family. He had a 
huge and compassionate heart who brought a quick quip and smile to all 
he met. Dale was a man of integrity who gave sage advice and wisdom who 
all could trust.
  When you met or talked to Dale, you felt special. You knew you had a 
true friend in Dale Golightly, he always had your back.
  Dale loved his wife, Vera, dearly. He was devoted to his children--
Brad, Randy, Dan, and Jean. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren 
brought him great joy. They will all carry on the good name and legacy 
he left them--a legacy of loving God, country, nature and agriculture, 
the friend, and the stranger.
  May God bless his soul. May Dale forever rest in his Saviour's arms 
in heaven.
       Sanford Dale Golightly was born June 18, 1933 at home in 
     Madison County, Iowa, the son of Jerome and Ethel (Reigle) 
     Golightly. He graduated from Van Meter High School in 1952 
     and served in the United States Army during the Korean 
     Conflict. He married Vera Jamison on June 19, 1955 at the 
     Trinity Lutheran Church in Van Meter.
       Dale came home from the service and started farming, never 
     really retiring. He was a member of the Trinity Lutheran 
     Church where he held various offices. He was on the Van Meter 
     School Board, the Booneville Co-op Board and the Madison 
     County Fair Board. Dale was a collector and enjoyed attending 
     flea markets and auctions. He enjoyed fishing with his 
     children, gardening and watching Iowa State basketball and 
     football. Above all else, Dale cherished spending time with 
     family, especially with his grandchildren.
       Dale died Tuesday, November 13, 2018 at Spurgeon Manor in 
     Dallas Center. He was 85 years old.
       Dale is survived by his wife of 63 years, Vera Golightly of 
     Van Meter; four children, Brad (Shelly) Golightly of Perry, 
     Randy (Anna) Golightly of Van Meter, Dan (Michelle) Golightly 
     of Waukee, and Jean (J.R.) Hall of Urbandale; five 
     grandchildren, Jana Ferguson, Austin (Brittney) Golightly, 
     Karlee Golightly, Jason (Angela) Mickelson and Nathan 
     Mickelson; three great-grandchildren, extended family and 
     friends.
       He was preceded in death by his parents, Jerome and Ethel 
     Golightly and a grandson, Bret Golightly



Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask my colleagues to 
join me in congratulating Kendall Haller of the Fatima Comets for 
winning the 2018 Missouri Girls Class 2 State Cross Country 
Championship.
   Kendall and Coach Marc Bridges should be commended for all of their 
hard work throughout this past year and for bringing home the state 
championship to their school and community.
   I ask you to join me in recognizing Kendall Haller for a job well 
done.
                        


Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Police 
Creating Accountability by Making Effective Recording Act, also known 
as the Police CAMERA Act, a bill I introduced today with several of my 
colleagues. If enacted, this bill would establish a grant program to 
assist state and local law enforcement with the deployment of body-worn 
camera programs.
  Safe communities require good police.
  Good policing requires public trust.
  Unfortunately, in far too many communities, that trust has become 
strained.
  In the wake of recent police shootings, our nation is facing sobering 
questions about the basic fairness of our criminal justice system. We 
face sobering questions about race.
  Over the past several years, the wider availability of video has 
shined a much-needed light on police use of deadly force. Without video 
of places like North Charleston, Staten Island, Chicago, Cleveland, 
Baton Rouge, Tulsa and Falcon Heights, Minnesota the world might never 
know what occurred.
  The more we see of these types of videos, the more we are left to 
wonder about all the incidents that were not recorded.
  Had there been better video of the shooting of Darrius Stewart in my 
home town of Memphis, it might have helped to better inform the grand 
jury that, sadly, refused to indict the police officer who was 
responsible.
  Justice is supposed to be blind, but it is not supposed to be blind 
to the facts.
  Police body cameras can help provide evidence and restore some much-
needed trust.
  They can protect both police and citizens alike.
  The vast majority of police are well meaning, dedicated public 
servants, and we depend upon them to keep us safe from criminals. They 
have dangerous jobs, as we have seen all too frequently.
  But the fact remains some officers go beyond the law in a callous 
disregard for due process. Their actions damage the public trust that 
is essential for good police to be able to serve and protect our 
communities.
  Police body cameras, alone, won't solve this problem. But they are an 
important step in the right direction.
  I urge all members to help pass the Police CAMERA Act quickly.
                        


Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a great 
soldier, dedicated husband, loving father, and loyal friend to many, 
Mr. Ralph William Hall. Sadly, Mr. Hall passed away on December 18, 
2018. His funeral service will be held on January 5, 2019 at 11 am at 
St. Timothy Episcopal Church located at 3601 Alabama Avenue SE, 
Washington, D.C. 20020.
  Mr. Ralph William Hall was born on January 25, 1919, in Metcalf, 
Georgia to the union of Adam and Maggie Franklin Hall. He was the 
oldest of five children. At an early age, he moved to Thomasville, 
Georgia where he lived with his parents and maternal grandmother. 
During this time, he learned to fish, hunt, and perform farm chores. 
But, it was also during this time that his unbreakable bond with God 
was cemented. He joined St. Mark AME Church and attended every Sunday. 
He also attended Allen Normal School, a private Congregational school 
where he learned self-discipline and bible study.
  A diligent student, Ralph graduated from Douglas High School, where 
he served as Senior Class President. He went on to continue his 
education at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, North Carolina, 
where he earned a degree in Mathematics in 1941. Ralph was drafted into 
the United States Army while in college, but was allowed to complete 
his degree requirements, then served faithfully for five years. He was 
discharged in 1946. He was initiated into the brotherhood of Omega Psi 
Phi Fraternity, Inc. and was a life member for 80 years until his 
passing.
  Following his discharge from the Army, his life would change forever 
as he was joined in holy matrimony with his college sweetheart, 
Virginia (Ginny) Holder.
  He moved his new family to Washington, D.C. and embarked on a career 
with the Federal Government that lasted for 35 years. During this time, 
two children were born to this union, Douglas and Angela.
  Sadly, Ginny became ill and passed in 1962. Mr. Hall was then left 
with the awesome task of being a single father. However, as with other 
challenges in his life, he was more than ready to meet this one. His 
strong and unwavering faith in God led him to become a member of the 
Jones United Methodist Church, where he proudly served as Chairman of 
the Trustee Board, where he led the completion of the Education 
Building along with serving as the Church School Superintendent.
  Another major life changing event for him occurred when he was 
introduced to Thelma Johnson by a dear Army Buddy and his wife, Milton 
and Evelyn Serailee. This led to their marriage in 1965 and the new 
family moved to Hillcrest area in Southeast Washington, D.C.
  Ralph Hall continued his love for service to humankind as a member of 
the Hillcrest Civic Association and as PTA President at Anne Beers 
Elementary School. In 1966, he and Thelma joined St. Timothy's 
Episcopal Church where he served many roles to include: Lay Reader, 
Diocensanis Delegate, Member of the Men of St. Timothy's (Most), and 
the Brotherhood of St. Andrews. He truly dedicated his life to the 
service of others. And was a constant example of sincerity, loyalty, 
and devotion to family.
  Madam Speaker, my wife Vivian and I, along with the 730,000 
constituents of the Second Congressional District of Georgia, salute 
and honor the life of Mr. Ralph William Hall. I ask my colleagues in 
the House of Representatives to join us in extending our deepest 
condolences to the Hall family during this difficult time of 
bereavement. We pray that that they will be consoled and comforted by 
an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks and months 
ahead.
                        


Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I am pleased to re-introduce H.R. 40, 
the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation proposals for African-
Americans Act. This legislation was first introduced by retired Member 
of Congress John Conyers of Michigan in 1989, and was intended to 
examine the institution of slavery in the colonies and the United 
States from 1619 to the present, and further recommend appropriate 
remedies.
  Since the initial introduction of this legislation, its proponents 
have made substantial progress in elevating the discussion of 
reparations and reparatory justice at the national level and joining 
the mainstream international debate on the issues. Though some have 
tried to deflect the importance of these conversations by focusing on 
individual monetary compensation, the real issue is whether and how 
this nation can come to grips with the legacy of slavery that still 
infects current society. Through legislation, resolutions, news, and 
litigation, we are moving closer to making more strides in the movement 
toward reparations.
  Today there are more people at the table--more activists, more 
scholars, more CEO's, more state and local officials, and more Members 
of Congress. However, despite this progress and the election of the 
first American President of African descent, the legacy of slavery 
lingers heavily in this nation. While we have focused on the social 
effects of slavery and segregation, its continuing economic 
implications remain largely ignored by mainstream analysis. These 
economic issues are the root cause of many critical issues in the 
African-American community today, such as education, healthcare and 
criminal justice policy, including policing practices. The call for 
reparations represents a commitment to entering a constructive dialogue 
on the role of slavery and racism in shaping present-day conditions in 
our community and American society.
  Over the last several years, we have had a distinguished academic and 
activist panel from
the National African American Reparations Commission dive into some of 
the most salient points in the reparations discussion. I am supporting 
this effort by continuing to hold the annual reparations retrospective 
at the Annual Legislative Conference of the Congressional Black Caucus.
  I believe that H.R. 40 is a crucial piece of legislation because it 
goes beyond exploring the economic implications of slavery and 
segregation. It is a holistic bill in the sense that it seeks to 
establish a commission to also examine the moral and social 
implications of slavery. In short, the Commission aims to study the 
impact of slavery and continuing discrimination against African-
Americans, resulting directly and indirectly from slavery to 
segregation to the desegregation process and the present day. The 
commission would also make recommendations concerning any form of 
apology and compensation to begin the long delayed process of atonement 
for slavery.
  With the over criminalization and policing of black bodies, a 
reoccurring issue in African-American communities, I believe this 
conversation is both relevant and crucial to restoring trust in 
governmental institutions in many communities. As in years past, I 
welcome open and constructive discourse on H.R. 40 and the creation of 
this commission in the 116th Congress. Though the times and 
circumstance may change, the principle problem of slavery continues to 
weigh heavily on this country. A federal commission can help us reach 
into this dark past and bring us into a brighter future.
